## Introduction

In recent years, the issue of climate change and environmental sustainability has gained prominence. One of the significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions is transportation. This project aims to analyze the relationship between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from vehicles using a simple linear regression model. By understanding this relationship, we can provide insights that may help in making informed decisions towards reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To investigate how fuel consumption correlates with CO2 emissions.
- To build a predictive model that estimates CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption.
- To visualize the findings to better understand the relationship.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this analysis includes various features related to vehicles, such as:
- **Fuel Consumption (L/100km)**: The amount of fuel consumed per distance traveled.
- **CO2 Emissions (g/km)**: The amount of carbon dioxide emitted per kilometer.
- Other relevant features may include the type of vehicle, engine size, and model year.

The dataset was sourced from a reputable database and is representative of various vehicle types.

## Methodology

The analysis follows these steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather the dataset and ensure its integrity.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values and removing outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships.
4. **Model Development**: Implement a simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
6. **Visualization**: Present the results using graphs and charts for clarity.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Collection

The dataset is available in a CSV format, which can be easily imported into Python for analysis. The necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are used for data manipulation and model building.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
- **Loading the Data**: Using Pandas to read the dataset.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and filling or removing any missing entries.
- **Outlier Detection**: Employing statistical methods to find and handle outliers that may skew the results.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, several visualizations are created:
- **Histograms**: To visualize the distribution of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- **Scatter Plots**: To observe the relationship between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions directly.
- **Correlation Matrix**: To understand how different features are related.

### 4. Model Development

A simple linear regression model is implemented to establish a relationship between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The process involves:
- **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant features for the model.
- **Splitting the Data**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Fitting the model to the training data.

### 5. Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variable(s).
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

### 6. Visualization

To present the findings, various plots are generated:
- **Regression Line**: A line showing the predicted CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption.
- **Residual Plots**: To visualize the errors made by the model.

## Results

The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, confirming that as fuel consumption increases, CO2 emissions also rise. The simple linear regression model shows a good fit, with an R² score indicating a significant amount of variance explained by the model.

Visualizations provide a clear representation of the relationship, and the regression line effectively illustrates the predictive capacity of fuel consumption on CO2 emissions.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the relationship between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions using a simple linear regression approach. The insights gained from this analysis can aid stakeholders in understanding the impact of fuel consumption on emissions, potentially guiding policies aimed at reducing transportation-related CO2 emissions.
